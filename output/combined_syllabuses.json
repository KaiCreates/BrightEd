Therefore, both mature during the course of the play and they both eventually step out of their comfort zone to embrace their Afro-Creole neighbours, Rita and Joe. Use of Irony The playwright uses contrasting East Indian characters like Sookdeo and Tiger to highlight a rapidly changing society and the role of education in it. Sookdeo, the old East Indian man is a drunkard but he is literate and he teaches the young Tiger to read. He has lost the respect even of the children in the community who taunt him. Ironically, old Sookdeo reads the newspaper to keep the village abreast of current happenings during the War, while Tiger later reads books and he stores and treasure them. It is ironical that the old drunkard Sookdeo who teaches Tiger to read is suspicious of new devices (the jutebox) and he is equally vicious in the face of new technology like the bulldozer which can uproot an entire balata tree in minutes. When the bulldozer comes to destroy his garden and he stands to lose all his money which he had buried under the mango tree, he rushes madly and fearlessly towards the bulldozer and dies. Use of symbols (symbolic characters and items) Sookdeo represents the old ways while Tiger symbolizes the new. Sookdeo represents the past, while Tiger symbolises present advancements through his books and radio. Tiger talks to Urmilla and explains change to her using the pepper tree as a symbol. He tells her, “I getting a man … You watch a tomatoes tree growing … or take the pepper tree by the kitchen there …You remember when it did small? … And look at it now, how big it get, and it bearing so much pepper…. I feel people like that… IF you don’t learn to think and reason you stay there all the time, day after day until you dead, like what what of happen to that pepper tree if I didn’t put manure on it (pg. 33)",
