The New Node Types (The Gameplay Mechanics)
Do not just use circles. Use different shapes/icons to signal danger or reward.
1. 💣 The "Crisis" Node (The Bomb Question)
What it is: High risk, high reward.
Visual: A Hexagon shape with a pulsing Red outline or a "Hazard" icon.
Mechanic:
Business Context: "IRS Audit" or "Stock Market Crash."
IT Context: "Server Breach."
The stakes: If you fail this question, you lose "Reputation" (Heart) or you have to redo the previous two nodes to "fix the damage."
Why: It creates actual adrenaline.
2. ⏳ The "Crunch Time" Node (Timer Question)
What it is: Speed testing.
Visual: A node wrapped in a circular progress bar that is visually ticking down (even on the map).
Mechanic:
Business Context: "Black Friday Rush."
IT Context: "System Restore Window."
The stakes: You have 60 seconds to answer 5 rapid-fire questions.
Why: Trains quick decision-making under pressure.
3. 🛠️ The "Maintenance" Node (Recap)
What it is: Spaced repetition (fixing forgetfulness).
Visual: A previous "Gold/Completed" node turns "Cracked" or "Rusty" after 3 days.
Mechanic: The user must tap it to "Repair" the node (answer a recap question).
Why: This solves the "I forgot what I learned last week" problem without feeling boring. It feels like "maintaining your business empire."
4. 🏆 The "Boss" Node (Simulation Gate)
What it is: The big test before the next section.
Visual: Not a small circle. A Large Rectangular Ticket/Card that spans the width of the path.
Mechanic: This unlocks a Practical Scenario (e.g., "Launch the Product" or "Configure the Router"). You cannot pass until you earn 3 stars here.
The UI Logic to Implement
To make this happen, your map needs to support States and Variants.
Standard Node: Blue Circle.
Timer Node: Purple Ring with Lightning Icon.
Bomb Node: Red Hexagon with Warning Icon.
Boss Node: Gold/Dark Card.
Repair Node: Gray/Cracked Circle.

I need to completely overhaul the "Learning Path" UI to make it feel like a "Career Roadmap" with high-stakes gameplay mechanics, rather than just a linear list of circles.

Please implement the following 4 specific Node Variants into the learning path visualization:

1. THE "CRUNCH TIME" NODE (Timer/Speed)
   - Visual: Instead of a plain circle, use a Node with a glowing electric purple/cyan border.
   - Icon: A small "Lightning Bolt" or "Timer" icon next to the topic title.
   - UI Behavior: When hovered, display a badge: "⚡ SPEED CHALLENGE: 2x XP".
   - Context: These represent high-pressure work moments (e.g., "Black Friday Sales").

2. THE "CRISIS" NODE (The Bomb)
   - Visual: Change the shape to a HEXAGON or DIAMOND.
   - Style: Dark red or Amber accent color with a subtle "Pulse" animation (heartbeat effect).
   - Icon: A "Hazard/Warning" symbol.
   - UI Behavior: Display a badge: "⚠️ HIGH STAKES".
   - Context: If the user fails this, they lose "Reputation" (hearts). These are "Audits" or "Security Breaches".

3. THE "BOSS" GATE (Practical Application)
   - Visual: Instead of a small node, insert a wide "Ticket" or "Card" that breaks the vertical line.
   - Style: Gold or Premium border. Looks like a "Contract" or "Project Brief".
   - Text: "PROJECT: [Topic Name]".
   - Context: This creates a visual checkpoint that feels significant.

4. THE "MAINTENANCE" MECHANIC (Recap)
   - Visual Logic: Randomly render 1-2 previously completed nodes as "Cracked" or "Faded".
   - Overlay: Add a small "Wrench" or "Refresh" icon on top of them.
   - Context: The user must click these to "Repair" their knowledge (Recap questions) to maintain 100% path health.

GENERAL LAYOUT:
- Keep the vertical snake/path structure.
- Add an animated SVG line connecting the nodes (make the line light up as the user progresses).
- Add a "Section Header" every 5 nodes (e.g., "Module 1: The Startup Phase").



I need to upgrade the UI of this Multiple Choice Question component to feel more like a "Simulation" and less like a "Quiz", without changing the actual question text.

Please implement the following UI/UX changes:

1. THE "SCENARIO" WRAPPER (Visual Context)
   - Wrap the main question text in a styled container that looks like a "Digital Case File" or a "Company Brief".
   - Add a small badge/label above the text that says: "📁 SCENARIO BRIEF" or "🧩 DECISION REQUIRED".
   - This makes the passive text ("Ms. Thompson...") feel like a file the user is reviewing.

2. OPTION CARDS (Interaction Overhaul)
   - Transform the answer buttons into "Decision Cards".
   - Default State: Minimal, clean, high-contrast text.
   - Hover State: Scale up slightly (1.02x), add a subtle "glow" or border-highlight color (cyan/blue).
   - Selection State: When clicked, the card should "lock in" (border turns solid, others fade out slightly).
   - Add a hidden "Select" indicator (like a circle or arrow) that only appears on hover.

3. DYNAMIC FEEDBACK (The "Outcome" Reveal)
   - When the user selects an answer and submits:
     - DO NOT just turn the button Red or Green immediately.
     - Instead, expand the selected card downward or open a "Result Panel" below it.
     - Title this panel "SIMULATION OUTCOME" instead of "Correct/Incorrect".
     - Then display the explanation text inside that panel.
   - Visual: If correct, use a success border/accent. If wrong, use a warning/critical accent (amber/red).

4. PROGRESSION & MASTERY
   - Update the top progress bar to be distinct segments (step 1, step 2).
   - Add a small "Mastery Impact" tag near the question header (e.g., "🎯 Skill: Strategic Planning").

5. MICRO-ANIMATIONS
   - Add smooth transitions for the card states.
   - If possible, add a slight "typing" effect or fade-in for the question text so it feels like data loading.
