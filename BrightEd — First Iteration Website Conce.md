BrightEd — First Iteration Website Concept (V1)
Purpose of the First Iteration

The website exists to:

Validate learning behavior

Prove adaptive learning works

Test simulated explanations

Generate engagement data

Prepare for mobile expansion

This is not a content dump site.
This is an interactive learning system.

1. Core Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

CXC-only content (SEA, CSEC, CAPE)

Simulation-first learning

Adaptive scaffolding (go down a level if weak)

Minimal quizzes, high-value checks

Explain → simulate → reflect

No international exams

No rote memorization

2. Website User Types
1. Student

Primary user.

2. Parent

Read-only observer.

3. Teacher (limited in V1)

Monitoring only.

4. Admin

Content + system oversight.

3. Website Pages & Navigation
Top-Level Navigation
Home | Learn | Simulate | Progress | Profile


(Compete can be Phase 2)

4. Onboarding Flow (Student)
Step 1: Account Creation

Email

Password

Step 2: Academic Setup

Country

School

Form Level

Exam Track (CSEC / CAPE)

Step 3: Diagnostic Entry

Short simulation-based diagnostic

No grades shown

Used only for placement

Outcome:

Personalized Learning Path created

5. Learning Model (The Heart of BrightEd)
Rule:

Students do not “choose random lessons.”

They are guided by:

Weakness detection

Stability scoring

Simulation performance

6. Learning Path Logic (Conceptual)
Knowledge Levels

Each topic exists in layers:

Foundational

Core

Applied

Exam-Ready

Stability Rule

A student must demonstrate:

Consistency

Understanding

Application

Before moving forward.

7. Automatic Level Scaffolding (Critical)

If:

Student selects Form 5

But fails foundational algebra

Then:

System recommends Form 3–4 algebra simulations

Form 5 content is temporarily locked

No punishment or ranking loss

Return condition:

Stability score increases

Applied simulations completed successfully

This applies to all subjects.

8. Simulation-First Learning (Core Experience)
What Is a Simulation?

A controlled interactive environment that teaches concepts through decisions and consequences.

9. Example: Principles of Business (PoB)
Virtual Business Environment

Student:

Creates a fake business

Manages finances

Sets prices

Observes profits/losses

Responds to market changes

Behind the scenes:

Every action maps to CXC syllabus objectives

10. Simulated Explanation Flow

Student makes a decision

System shows outcome

System explains why

Student reflects with guided prompt

System checks understanding (1–2 questions max)

No long quizzes.
No memorization.

11. Subject-Wide Simulation Philosophy
Subject	Simulation Concept
Math	Applied scenarios
PoB	Business sandbox
Economics	Country economy
Science	Virtual lab
Geography	Climate + map
IT	System design

Each simulation:

Teaches concepts

Tests reasoning

Feeds mastery engine

12. Minimal Quizzing (Intentional)

Quizzes are used ONLY to:

Confirm understanding

Detect misconceptions

Rules:

5–10 questions max

Immediate explanation

No drilling loops

13. Adaptive Recommendation System (Concept)

The system constantly asks:

“What does this student need next to improve?”

Recommendations include:

Simulation

Explanation module

Lower-form content

Reflection activity

Students see:

“Recommended for you”
With clear reasons.

14. Progress & Feedback Page
What Students See

Topic mastery bars

Stability indicators

Simulation completion

Learning streaks

What They Don’t See

Harsh grades

Failure labels

Public comparison (yet)

15. Parent Access (V1)

Parents:

Use a parent code

Link to child account

View:

Progress summaries

Strengths/weaknesses

Study consistency

Parents cannot:

Change content

Interfere with learning

16. Teacher View (Limited V1)

Teachers can:

View class-level trends

See topic mastery distribution

Identify struggling students

No grading automation yet.

17. Engagement Strategy (24/7 Use)

Students return because:

Simulations evolve

Scenarios unlock

Mastery gates progression

Personal improvement is visible

Not because of pressure.

18. What V1 Explicitly Does NOT Include

International exams

Real money markets

Competitive rankings

Open chatbots

Social media features

Those come later.

19. Success Criteria for V1

You win if:

Students stay longer than 20 minutes/session

Weak students improve stability

Simulations are replayed voluntarily

Parents check dashboards weekly

20. Why This First Iteration Works

Deep learning over surface scores

CXC-aligned trust

Scalable to mobile

Ministry-ready

Behavior-driven design

This is not a study website.

It is a learning system.

What Cursor Should Build From This

Cursor should treat this document as:

Product requirements

UX logic

Learning philosophy

System rules

Not a wireframe dump.
