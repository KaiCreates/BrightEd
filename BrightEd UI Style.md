BrightEd UI Design System — V1 Website
1. Design Goal (Clarity First)

BrightEd’s UI must feel:

Academic, not corporate

Playful, not childish

Calm, not dull

Advanced, not intimidating

The user should feel:

“This looks serious, but I want to stay.”

2. Visual Identity Pillars
Pillar 1 — Calm Concentration

Encourages long study sessions

Reduces cognitive fatigue

Pillar 2 — Controlled Energy

Keeps engagement high

Rewards progress visually

Pillar 3 — Intelligent Play

Feels interactive and alive

Never chaotic or gimmicky

3. Color System (Purpose-Driven)
Primary Colors (Base Layer)

Used for backgrounds, containers, nav bars.

Deep Teal / Blue-Green

Main background

Promotes calm focus

Soft Navy Blue

Headers

Navigation text

These colors dominate 70–75% of the UI.

Secondary Colors (Engagement Layer)

Used for buttons, progress, highlights.

Warm Yellow

Progress indicators

Rewards

“You’re doing well” feedback

Soft Orange

Calls to action

Warnings without stress

Usage: 15–20%

Accent Colors (Cognitive Activation)

Used sparingly.

Light Purple / Lavender

Deep thinking moments

Simulation mode

“Apply what you learned”

Red

Errors

Time pressure

Competition highlights

Usage: <5%

Rule:
Red never appears during calm learning states.

4. Typography (Extremely Important)
Heading Font

Rounded, friendly, modern

Slight personality (Duolingo-like)

Purpose:

Reduces intimidation

Feels human

Body Font

Clean, high-legibility

Optimized for long reading

Numbers / Data

Monospace or semi-monospace

Used for stats, timers, progress

5. Layout Philosophy
Not a “School Website”

Avoid:

Long text blocks

Dense menus

Table-heavy layouts

PDF-style pages

Core Layout Pattern

Every page follows:

[ Context Header ]
[ Primary Action ]
[ Interactive Content ]
[ Subtle Feedback ]


This keeps the user moving, not reading endlessly.

6. Homepage (Student View)
Above the Fold

Welcome message

“Continue where you left off”

One primary button (Start / Resume)

No clutter.

Mid Section

Today’s recommendation

Progress summary (visual bars, not numbers)

Bottom Section

Optional challenges

Soft discovery

7. Animations & Motion Design (High Priority)
Philosophy

Motion explains cause and effect, not decoration.

Types of Animations
Micro-Interactions

Button hover lifts

Progress bar fills

Checkmarks bounce slightly

Purpose:

Dopamine reinforcement

Feedback clarity

Page slides

Fade + scale

Smooth easing

Purpose:

Maintain flow

Reduce mental friction
