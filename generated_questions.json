      "A chain of mainly small islands and coastal territories",
      "One large continuous landmass in the Atlantic Ocean",
      "A group of large mountainous countries in South America",
      "An isolated single island surrounded by polar ice"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The Caribbean is defined geographically as an archipelago consisting predominantly of small island states and coastal mainland territories bounded by the Caribbean Sea. Option B incorrectly suggests a continental landmass like Australia, which contradicts the fragmented island nature of the region. Option C confuses the Caribbean with South American continental states, while Option D introduces polar characteristics that are geographically impossible for this tropical region.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The majority of Caribbean territories are classified as Small Island Developing States (SIDS) due to their limited land area, small populations, and specific economic vulnerability challenges. Option B incorrectly describes continental-sized countries like Brazil or Canada, which are not Caribbean territories. Option C refers to large landmasses like India or Arabia, while Option D describes Arctic or Antarctic regions with no relevance to the tropical Caribbean.",

      "Numerous small islands and cays in a tropical sea",
      "Vast desert plains and inland sand dunes",
      "A single peninsula attached to North America",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The Caribbean is fundamentally an archipelagic region comprising thousands of small islands, islets, and cays scattered across the Caribbean Sea within a tropical climate zone. Option B describes desert geography characteristic of regions like the Sahara or Arabian Peninsula, not the Caribbean's environment. Option C inaccurately describes the region as a single land bridge like Florida, ignoring the multiple distinct island chains. Option D describes polar environments found in Greenland or Antarctica, which contrast sharply with the Caribbean's tropical climate.",
