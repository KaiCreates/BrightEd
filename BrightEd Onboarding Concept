Review of Your Proposed Onboarding (Quick Assessment)

Your fields:

Full name

Current age

Form

Country

School

This is not wrong, but it has three problems:

Age is unstable data (changes yearly, causes errors)

Form alone is not enough for adaptive placement

It feels like registration, not the start of a learning journey

For BrightEd, onboarding must:

Collect only what is essential

Set expectations

Prepare the adaptive engine

Feel intelligent, not bureaucratic

2. BrightEd V1 Onboarding — Improved Concept
Core Principle

Onboarding is placement, not paperwork.

We want to:

Identify academic context

Set the learning track

Reduce wrong assumptions

Begin personalization immediately

3. Step-by-Step Onboarding Flow (Optimized)
Screen 1 — Welcome & Intent

Purpose: Set trust and explain what happens next.

Content:

Welcome message

Short line:

“BrightEd adapts to how you actually learn. We’ll ask a few questions to personalize your experience.”

Button:
Start Setup

Screen 2 — Identity (Minimal & Safe)

Fields:

First Name

Last Name (optional display control)

Why:

Name is used for personalization

Avoids early privacy resistance

Screen 3 — Academic Context (Core Data)

Fields:

Country (dropdown)

School (searchable dropdown)

Exam Track:

CSEC

CAPE

Why:

Locks content to CXC

Prevents international material

Enables school-level analytics

Screen 4 — Current Academic Level (Better Than Age)

Instead of age, use learning stage.

Fields:

Current Form:

Form 1

Form 2

…

Form 6

Optional helper text:

“This helps us start you at the right level. If needed, BrightEd will adjust.”

Why this beats age:

Directly maps to syllabus

Avoids age-based misplacement

Works for repeaters, transfers, and late starters

Screen 5 — Subject Selection (Intent Signal)

Prompt:

“Which subjects are you currently studying?”

Selectable list:

Mathematics

English A

Principles of Business

Integrated Science

Economics

Geography

etc.

Why:

Focuses onboarding

Prevents content overload

Allows subject-specific simulations

Screen 6 — Learning Goal (Motivation Hook)

Prompt:

“What are you working toward right now?”

Options:

Improve understanding

Prepare for exams

Catch up on weak areas

Stay consistent

This sets tone, not restriction.

Screen 7 — Diagnostic Setup (Expectation Management)

Message:

“Before we begin, BrightEd will run a short interactive diagnostic to understand how you learn.”

Key points:

No grades

No penalties

Used only for personalization

Button:
Begin Diagnostic

4. Diagnostic Experience (Part of Onboarding)

This is where BrightEd separates itself.

What It Is

A mini simulation

Subject-based

10–15 minutes max

What It Tests

Foundational understanding

Application

Reasoning speed

Conceptual gaps

What It Is NOT

A long test

A stressful exam

A visible score

5. Onboarding Completion Screen (Critical)
Message Example

“Your learning path is ready.”

Display:

Starting level per subject

First recommended simulation

Explanation:

“We’ll adjust as you improve.”

Primary Button:
Start Learning

6. Why This Onboarding Is Better Than the Original
Your Version

Static

Form-based

Assumes correctness

No intelligence

This Version

Adaptive

Context-aware

Diagnostic-driven

Emotionally reassuring

Academically accurate

It prevents misplacement, which is the #1 reason EdTech fails.

7. Data Collected (Clean Summary)

Collected:

Name

Country

School

Exam track

Form

Subjects

Learning intent

Diagnostic results

Not collected:

Age

Sensitive personal data

Unnecessary identifiers

8. What This Enables Immediately

Accurate content gating

Lower-form recommendations when needed

Simulation targeting

Trust with parents and schools

Long session times from day one
