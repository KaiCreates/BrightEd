🔥 NABLE LEARNING ALGORITHM
Complete Fixes, Architecture, and Implementation Guide
1. CORE PROBLEM YOU’RE FIXING

Right now, most learning systems fail because they:

❌ Treat learning as quizzes
❌ Only support MCQs
❌ Don’t understand why a learner struggles
❌ Don’t connect learning across features
❌ Don’t adapt format, only difficulty

Your fix:

NABLE is a concept-driven, interaction-aware, adaptive learning engine.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE (DO NOT SKIP THIS)
🔑 NABLE DOES NOT TRACK SCORES

It tracks CONCEPT MASTERY

Everything else (questions, boards, images, chat, business sims) feeds concept mastery updates.

3. REQUIRED DATA MODELS (MANDATORY)
3.1 Concept Graph (Knowledge Graph)

Each subject must be broken into concept nodes.

Example:

Mathematics
 └─ Algebra
    ├─ Linear Equations
    ├─ Quadratic Equations
    └─ Factorization


Each concept has:

prerequisites

difficulty weight

real-world relevance

📌 Fix: Stop using “topic completion”. Use concept dependencies.

3.2 Concept Mastery Table

For every user + concept:

{
  "user_id": "...",
  "concept": "quadratic_equations",
  "mastery": 0.37,
  "confidence": 0.42,
  "last_interaction": "2026-01-26"
}


📌 Fix:

Mastery ≠ score

Confidence ≠ mastery

Time matters

3.3 Question Metadata (Critical Fix)

Every question MUST have:

{
  "concepts": ["quadratics", "factoring"],
  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_type": "worked_solution",
  "real_world_context": true,
  "estimated_time": 4
}


📌 Fix:
If a question does not map to concepts → it is useless to NABLE.

4. QUESTION TYPE EXPANSION (MANDATORY FIX)

You MUST stop treating all questions the same.

Supported Types (Required)
Type	Purpose
MCQ	Recall & quick checks
Short Answer	Concept clarity
Worked Solution	Reasoning
Image-Based	Visual understanding
Whiteboard Task	Process & steps
Scenario	Application

📌 Fix:
NABLE selects question type, not just question.

5. NABLE DECISION ENGINE (CORE LOGIC)
NABLE makes decisions in this order:
STEP 1: Identify Weak Concepts
Lowest mastery + high prerequisite importance

STEP 2: Choose Best Learning Format

Based on:

Past success

Engagement time

Question fatigue

Visual vs textual preference

STEP 3: Select Question / Activity

Could be:

Question

Whiteboard task

Interactive image

Peer collaboration

📌 Fix:
Do NOT always serve a question.

6. MASTERY UPDATE LOGIC (MOST IMPORTANT FIX)
Old (Wrong)
Correct = +0.1
Wrong = -0.1

New (Correct)

Mastery update uses:

Signal	Weight
Correctness	Medium
Time spent	High
Explanation quality	Very High
Repeated attempts	Negative
Teaching others	Massive boost
Example Update Formula (Conceptual)
Δmastery = (correctness × 0.3)
         + (process_quality × 0.4)
         + (engagement × 0.2)
         + (collaboration × 0.1)


📌 Fix:
A student who explains well but answers wrong still gains mastery.

7. WHITEBOARD INTEGRATION FIXES

Whiteboards are graded learning environments, not drawing tools.

NABLE Tracks:

Steps taken

Order of actions

Corrections made

Peer contributions

Final outcome

📌 Fix:
Whiteboard interactions update mastery more than MCQs.

8. IMAGE → THEORY → PRACTICE PIPELINE (ALGORITHM FIX)

When an image is uploaded:

Detect concepts

Generate theory explanation

Generate practical use cases

Generate follow-up questions

Update mastery based on interaction

📌 Fix:
Images become learning nodes, not static media.

9. SOCIAL LEARNING FIXES (DISCORD INTEGRATION)
NABLE Uses Social Data To:

Recommend study partners

Detect peer tutors

Suggest group boards

Boost mastery for teaching

📌 Fix:
Teaching = faster mastery gain than solo learning.

10. ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY FIX

Difficulty should NOT increase just because user is correct.

Increase difficulty ONLY if:

Mastery > threshold

Confidence stable

Time per question reasonable

📌 Fix:
Fast guessing ≠ readiness.

11. FATIGUE & VARIETY FIX

NABLE must prevent:

Question fatigue

Format burnout

Rules:

Max 3 same-type questions in a row

Force recap after concept clusters

Switch modality when engagement drops

12. RECAP SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Every 3–5 learning actions:

Inject recap

Mixed question types

Cross-concept links

📌 Fix:
No continuous forward motion without consolidation.

13. BUSINESS / PRACTICAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION

Business decisions update learning:

Action	Learning Trigger
Miss payroll	Financial literacy
Bad partnership	Ethics & decision making
Tax issues	Applied math

📌 Fix:
Real-world mistakes = learning entry points.

14. ONBOARDING & EVALUATION FIX

Evaluation must:

Use mixed formats

Adapt in real time

Produce mastery map, not score

📌 Fix:
Stop sending users to homepage after evaluation.

15. ALGORITHM SAFEGUARDS (IMPORTANT)

You MUST implement:

Floor mastery (never drop to zero)

Grace thresholds

Explain why NABLE recommends something

Transparency builds trust.

16. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (WITH WINDSURF AI)
Step Order (IMPORTANT)

Lock concept graph

Normalize question schema

Implement mastery tracking

Build decision engine (rules first)

Connect whiteboards

Connect images

Connect social hub

Tune weights over time

📌 Do NOT jump to ML early.

17. WHAT MAKES YOUR SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORK

✔ Concept-first
✔ Interaction-aware
✔ Multi-format
✔ Socially reinforced
✔ Real-world connected
✔ Transparent

This is how real adaptive learning systems are built — simplified, controlled, and scalable.

18. FINAL TRUTH (IMPORTANT)

You are not building:

“An AI that gives questions”

You are building:

A learning intelligence that understands humans learning in real environments.
