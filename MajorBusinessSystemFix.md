6. WHY THIS FEELS REAL

No perfect build

Every strength creates weakness

People matter more than money

Stress is a resource

Ethics are gameplay, not dialogue

EMPLOYEE PERSONALITY + STAT MODEL (CORE AI SYSTEM)

This is the living layer of BrightEd. Employees are not workers — they are agents.

A. EMPLOYEE CORE STATS (VISIBLE + HIDDEN)
Visible Stats (Player Sees)

Skill (0–100)
Output quality & speed

Mood (0–100)
Affects dialogue, mistakes

Loyalty (0–100)
Quit chance, sabotage risk

Stress (0–100)
Burnout, illness, conflicts

Energy (0–100)
Daily performance ceiling

Hidden Stats (AI-Driven)

Ambition
Wants promotion / ownership

Ethics
Will exploit, lie, leak info

Ego
Reacts badly to criticism

Resilience
Handles pressure better

Social Influence
Spreads mood to others

These hidden stats change over time.

B. PERSONALITY ARCHETYPES (MIXED, NOT PURE)

Each employee spawns with 2 dominant traits.

Examples:

The Grinder

High resilience

– High stress tolerance, low loyalty

Dialogue: “I’ll do it. Just don’t slow me down.”

The Idealist

Ethics, morale boost

– Dislikes exploitative paths

Dialogue: “This isn’t why I joined.”

The Opportunist

Learns fast

– Will leave for better offer

Dialogue: “What’s next for me here?”

The Diva

High output

– High ego, conflict-prone

Dialogue: “You need me more than I need this job.”

The Loyalist

Retention, trust

– Resistant to change

Dialogue: “We’ve always done it this way.”

C. STAT INTERACTIONS (WHY IT FEELS REAL)

High Skill + Low Mood → silent errors

High Stress + Ego → meeting blowups

Low Loyalty + High Ambition → poaching events

Low Ethics → insider trading, theft, leaks

2. TABLET ZOOM MEETING — ANIMATION SYSTEM

This is your emotional realism engine.

A. MEETING INTERFACE

Tablet opens → “Business Calls”

Zoom-style grid

Each NPC:

Camera on/off

Background reflects workplace

Live facial expressions

B. ANIMATION STATES (PER EMPLOYEE)

C. DYNAMIC DIALOGUE SYSTEM

“We’re cutting corners again. This will hurt us later.”

Opportunist:

“If we don’t scale now, someone else will.”

Diva:

“I’m carrying this team and still getting blamed?”

D. PLAYER CHOICES (NO PERFECT ANSWER)

Support → morale ↑, authority ↓

Dismiss → authority ↑, loyalty ↓

Delay → stress ↑ across team

Invest → cash ↓, trust ↑

Consequences stack.

3. BUSINESS STOCK MARKET (PLAYER-DRIVEN ECONOMY)

This is not fake stock. It’s a social market.

A. BUSINESS STOCK EXCHANGE (BSE)

Accessed via:
📱 Tablet → “Business Stock Market”

B. LISTED BUSINESSES

4. CROSS-SYSTEM CONSEQUENCES (WHY THIS IS DEEP)

Exploit staff → profits ↑ → stock ↑ → insider leaks → crash

Ethical leader → slow growth → stable stock → loyal buyers

Hostile takeover → fast expansion → culture collapse

No system is isolated.

5. CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

BrightEd teaches:

Power changes people

Numbers lie, people don’t

Growth has a cost

Leadership is uncomfortable

Trust is expensive


1. DIALOGUE RULE ENGINE (HOW LINES ARE GENERATED)

This is not scripted dialogue. It’s assembled dialogue.

A. DIALOGUE GENERATION PIPELINE

Every spoken line is generated using this stack:

Context → Personality → Emotion → Intent → Tone → Line Template → Modifier

B. CONTEXT INPUTS (WHAT TRIGGERS SPEECH)

Context is pulled from live game state:

Business health (profit/loss)

Recent player decisions

Meeting type (crisis, review, conflict)

Employee stats (Mood, Stress, Loyalty)

Power balance (ownership %, authority)

Example Context Tags:

missed_payroll

overworked_team

record_profit

hostile_takeover

tax_increase

late_supplier_payment

C. PERSONALITY FILTER (WHO IS SPEAKING)

Each archetype alters what they care about.

Archetype	Prioritizes	Ignores
Idealist	Ethics, fairness	Profit excuses
Diva	Recognition	Team suffering
Grinder	Results	Burnout
Opportunist	Advancement	Loyalty
Loyalist	Stability	Innovation

This decides topic selection.

D. EMOTIONAL STATE ENGINE

Emotion is calculated from stats:

Emotion = f(Mood, Stress, Loyalty, Ego)


Possible emotional states:

Calm

Defensive

Frustrated

Resentful

Motivated

Disengaged

This affects:

Sentence length

Interruptions

Body language

Camera behavior

E. INTENT SELECTION (WHY THEY ARE TALKING)

Each line has a goal:

Complain

Warn

Request

Defend

Threaten (quit, expose, leave)

Inspire

Manipulate

Low loyalty + high ambition = self-serving intent

F. TONE MODIFIERS

Tone alters delivery:

Professional

Sarcastic

Passive-aggressive

Emotional

Blunt

Polite but cold

Tone is chosen from:

Ego

Authority gap

Past meeting outcomes

G. LINE TEMPLATES (MODULAR)

Templates are short and reusable:

Template:

“This pace isn’t sustainable. We’re already {symptom}.”

Symptom Pool:

burning out

missing details

cutting corners

losing focus

H. FINAL MODIFIERS (REALISM LAYER)

Hesitation (“uh”, pauses)

Interruptions

Camera off excuses

Eye-roll animations

Subtitles jitter on anger

I. EXAMPLE (ONE EVENT, 3 OUTPUTS)

Context: Missed payroll + high stress

Idealist:

“I don’t feel good about this. People have bills, and we’re acting like numbers come first.”

Diva:

“So payments are late, but expectations aren’t? Interesting.”

Opportunist:

“If this keeps happening, I’ll need to rethink my position here.”

2. STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY MODEL (PLAYER-DRIVEN)

This is controlled chaos, not randomness.

A. PRICE CALCULATION CORE
Price Change =
  Financial Performance
+ Market Sentiment
+ News Impact
+ Player Behavior
+ Volatility Modifier

B. VOLATILITY TYPES
Low Volatility

Mature businesses

Ethical paths

Stable employees

Feel: Predictable, boring, safe

High Volatility

Startups

Exploitative paths

Drama-heavy leadership

Feel: Stressful, addictive, risky

C. MARKET SENTIMENT ENGINE

Sentiment is global and local:

Industry hype

Economic downturns

Scandals

Government regulation

Sentiment decays slowly — hype fades, damage lingers.

D. PLAYER-CAUSED EVENTS

Layoffs → price spike → delayed crash

Ethical decision → short dip → long growth

Hostile takeover → initial pump → instability

Players feel regret and pressure.

E. MANIPULATION & CONSEQUENCES

Dark paths allow:

Fake growth signals

Employee exploitation

Information suppression

Counter-events:

Whistleblowers

Audits

Market bans

Reputation collapse

F. OWNERSHIP INFLUENCE
Ownership %	Power
<10%	Passive investor
10–25%	Vote access
25–49%	Board influence
50%+	Control

More power = more stress & scrutiny.

3. BILL / TAX / OBLIGATION SYSTEM (LIVING PRESSURE)

This system exists to interrupt comfort.

A. BILL TYPES
Operational Bills

Rent

Utilities

Internet

Software licenses

Employee Bills

Payroll

Benefits

Overtime penalties

Government

Taxes

Fines

Compliance fees

Financial

Loan repayments

Investor dividends

Insurance

B. BILL DELIVERY ANIMATION SYSTEM

Ignore (danger)

Each choice alters:

Reputation

Stock price

Legal risk

D. TAX SYSTEM (REAL CONSEQUENCES)

Taxes scale with:

Industry

Ethics

Region

Avoidance paths exist — but trigger audits.

Audit animation:

Cold UI

Silent NPCs

No background music

E. MISSED BILL CONSEQUENCES
Missed	Result
Rent	Shutdown threat
Payroll	Walkouts
Taxes	Seizures
Loans	Asset freeze
4. SYSTEM SYNERGY (WHY THIS HITS HARD)

Missed payroll → dialogue anger → stock dip → investor panic

Tax audit → employee fear → productivity drop

Bill spam → stress accumulation → bad decisions

Pressure is constant but fair.

BUSINESS NET WORTH SYSTEM (LEADERBOARD LOGIC)
CORE PRINCIPLE

Cash ≠ Value
A broke but trusted company can be worth more than a rich, unstable one.

Leaderboards rank by Business Net Worth, not balance.

1. BUSINESS NET WORTH FORMULA (HIGH LEVEL)
Business Net Worth =
  Liquid Assets
+ Business Assets
+ Brand / Reputation Value
+ Market Position Value
+ Growth Expectation
- Risk & Liabilities


This value updates continuously, not only on profit events.

2. COMPONENT BREAKDOWN
A. Liquid Assets 💵

What the business can immediately use.

Includes:

Cash on hand

Savings

Short-term investments

Unsold inventory (depreciated)

⚠️ Diminishing returns:
Too much idle cash = lower efficiency score

B. Business Assets 🏢

Long-term tangible value.

Includes:

Buildings / locations

Equipment

Vehicles

Software licenses

Patents / IP

Owned subsidiaries

Assets:

Appreciate with upgrades

Depreciate with neglect

Lose value during crises

C. Brand & Reputation Value ⭐ (CRITICAL)

This is where realism hits.

Reputation comes from:

Employee satisfaction

Customer reviews

Ethical decisions

Media events

Stock market stability

Reputation Value =
  Trust Score × Visibility × Consistency


High reputation:

Boosts valuation

Protects during downturns

Attracts investors & talent

Low reputation:

Discounts valuation

Increases volatility

Triggers scandals faster

D. Market Position Value 📊

How important the business is in its sector.

Based on:

Market share

Unique offerings

Industry dominance

Competition pressure

Monopolies = high value but high regulation risk.

E. Growth Expectation 📈

Future potential (investor thinking).

Influenced by:

Recent growth trend

Innovation level

Expansion plans

Leadership stability

Fast growth ≠ good growth
Unstable growth increases risk penalty.

F. Risk & Liabilities 🔥 (SUBTRACTION)

Includes:

Loans

Unpaid bills

Lawsuits

Tax risk

Employee unrest

Ethical violations

Hidden risk slowly leaks into public valuation.

3. FINAL NET WORTH CALCULATION (SIMPLIFIED)
Net Worth =
(Base Assets + Cash)
× Reputation Multiplier
× Growth Multiplier
× Stability Multiplier
- Liabilities

Example:

Cash: $200k

Assets: $500k

Reputation: High (1.4×)

Growth: Moderate (1.2×)

Stability: Good (1.1×)

Liabilities: $150k

→ Net Worth ≈ $1.3M, not $200k

4. LEADERBOARD DESIGN (WHAT PLAYERS SEE)
A. Leaderboard Columns

Rank

Business Name

Industry

Net Worth

Reputation Tier

Growth Trend (↑ ↓ →)

Risk Indicator ⚠️

B. WHY THIS FEELS FAIR

Ethical players rise slowly but permanently

Exploiters spike then crash

One scandal can drop 20 ranks

Long-term thinkers dominate

5. NET WORTH EVENTS (DRAMA BUILDER)

Events that change value without cash:

Viral praise → Reputation spike

Employee walkout → Stability crash

Audit → Risk reveal

Acquisition → Asset surge

Lawsuit → Multiplier collapse

Leaderboard movement creates:

Jealousy

Pressure

Ambition

Fear of falling

6. PLAYER FEEDBACK (IMPORTANT)

When net worth changes:

Subtle UI pulse

News ticker update

NPC reactions

Investor messages

Not always celebratory — sometimes ominous.

7. EDGE CASES (REALISM)

Rich but hated business → low rank

Small trusted startup → high potential value

Cash hoarders → stagnant valuation

Overleveraged giants → fragile rank

8. WHY THIS COMPLETES THE SYSTEM

This ties together:

Dialogue (people react to worth, not cash)

Stock market (valuation logic shared)

Bills (liabilities reduce worth)

Ethics (multiplier control)

Leadership (stability factor)

BrightEd now simulates real capitalism, pressure, and leadership psychology, not arcade money.
