# Google Sign-In Integration

I have successfully integrated Google Sign-In into the login page.

## Changes
- Modified `app/login/page.tsx`
- Added `GoogleAuthProvider` and `signInWithPopup` logic.
- Added a "Sign in with Google" button.

## Usage
Click the Google button on the login page to sign in. New users will have a profile automatically created.
