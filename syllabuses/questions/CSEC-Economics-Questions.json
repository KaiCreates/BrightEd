    "explanation": "Factors of production are the resources used to produce goods and services: land (natural resources), labor (human effort), capital (man-made aids to production), and enterprise (organizational skill).

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A bowed-out (concave) PPF reflects increasing opportunity costs because resources are not perfectly adaptable to alternative uses. For example, land suitable for tourism in Jamaica may be poor for agriculture, and vice versa. As the nation produces more of one good, it must sacrifice increasingly larger quantities of the other good, as less suitable resources must be transferred.",

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Points inside the PPC represent inefficient use of resources or unemployment.

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "A free good has no opportunity cost because it is abundant in nature and not scarce. Sunlight is available without sacrificing alternative uses of resources.

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "When a choice is made between alternatives, the opportunity cost is the next best alternative that is sacrificed. By choosing healthcare, the government gives up the opportunity to upgrade tourism infrastructure.

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The central economic problem is scarcity. Scarcity exists because resources (land, labor, capital, enterprise) are limited while human wants are unlimited.

    "answer": 1,

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Production Possibility Frontier illustrates scarcity and opportunity cost. To increase cocoa production by 20 tons (from 50 to 70), the economy must decrease banana production by 20 tons (from 100 to 80).

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Scarcity forces economic agents to make choices.

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Opportunity cost is defined as the next best alternative foregone.

      "Capital; interest",
      "Land; rent",
      "Labour; wages",
      "Entrepreneurship; profit"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Land includes all natural resources, not just agricultural soil. Beachfront property is a natural resource essential to Caribbean tourism. The reward for the use of land is rent.

    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Capital refers to manufactured goods (machinery, equipment, buildings) used to produce other goods and services. The reward for capital is interest. Students often confuse capital with money or land, but in economics, capital is strictly physical assets used in production, such as agricultural machinery vital to Caribbean sugar industries.",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Land refers to all natural resources used in production, including soil, climate, and water sources. The irrigation system is capital (man-made), wages are the reward for labour rather than a factor itself, and business acumen represents entrepreneurship.",

      "Higher rental costs for agricultural land",
      "Reduced need for entrepreneurial skills"

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "While specialization increases productivity (advantage), a key disadvantage is worker monotony/boredom from performing the same repetitive task (such as cutting cane or loading).

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Capital (specifically physical capital) refers to manufactured goods such as machinery, tools, and equipment used in the production of other goods and services. While the tractor operates on land, it is not 'Land' (natural resources). The farmer's decision-making represents entrepreneurship, but the tractor itself is capital.",

    "question": "As a Caribbean economy develops from an agricultural base to a service-oriented economy, which trend is most likely to occur?",
    "options": [
      "The primary sector's share of GDP increases while employment in the tertiary sector declines",
      "The secondary sector becomes the dominant employer, replacing both agriculture and services",
      "The tertiary sector's contribution to GDP increases relative to the primary sector",
      "Employment in primary sector activities increases due to mechanization"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Economic development typically involves a structural shift where the tertiary sector (tourism, financial services) grows to dominate GDP and employment, while the primary sector (agriculture, mining) declines in relative importance.

    "options": [
      "Primary production because it involves agricultural products",

      "Tertiary production because it provides a utility service to consumers",
      "Quaternary production because it involves chemical processing technology"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Secondary production involves manufacturing, construction, and processing activities that transform raw materials into finished or semi-finished goods. While growing sugar cane is primary sector activity, the milling and refining process changes the physical form of the material, making it secondary. A common misconception is assuming that because sugar originates from agriculture, all related activities are primary.",

      "The primary and secondary sectors contribute equally to employment and national output"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Developed Caribbean economies like Barbados and The Bahamas have transitioned to service-based economies where the tertiary sector (tourism, international business, financial services, transport) dominates both GDP and employment. This represents a shift from the colonial era when sugar (primary) dominated. Students often confuse tourism with primary sector activity because it relies on natural beauty, but it is fundamentally a service activity (tertiary).",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In the early stages of development, most Caribbean territories (like historical Saint Lucia, Grenada, or Belize) had the majority of workers engaged in primary activities such as subsistence farming, fishing, or plantation agriculture. This reflects the historical colonial structure where territories exported raw materials. The shift to secondary and tertiary employment occurs later with industrialization and modernization.

    "options": [
      "It will increase as consumers stock up before prices rise further",
      "It will decrease as consumers switch to substitute products",
      "It will remain unchanged because cocoa is an essential good",
      "It will first increase then decrease due to the wealth effect"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Law of Demand states that, ceteris paribus, there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. When price rises, quantity demanded falls (contraction of demand). Option A confuses this with expectations of future price changes (a shift factor), C confuses cocoa with perfectly inelastic goods, and D describes a Giffen good scenario which violates the standard Law of Demand.",

      "A leftward shift indicating a decrease in supply",
      "A rightward shift indicating an increase in supply",
      "A downward movement along the supply curve",
      "No change as price alone determines supply"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Higher input costs (like fertilizer) reduce profitability at each price level, causing producers to supply less. This decrease in supply is shown as a leftward shift of the curve. Only changes in the good's own price cause movements along the curve; changes in production costs cause shifts.",

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The supply schedule demonstrates the Law of Supply, showing a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied. As price rises from $5 to $15, quantity supplied increases from 100 to 300 units, reflecting producers' willingness to supply more at higher prices.",

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "A movement along the supply curve occurs only when the price of the good itself changes, causing a change in quantity supplied. When global demand increases the price of natural gas, producers respond by increasing quantity supplied (extension of supply).

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Law of Supply states that, ceteris paribus, there is a direct (positive) relationship between price and quantity supplied. When the price of Blue Mountain coffee rises, Jamaican farmers are incentivized to harvest more intensively and bring more beans to market to capitalize on higher profits, resulting in an extension of supply along the curve.

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Technological improvements that reduce production costs cause an increase in supply, represented by a rightward shift of the supply curve. At every price level, producers are now willing and able to supply more fish than before because they can maintain profitability despite lower market prices. Options A and B incorrectly describe movements along the curve, which only occur when the product's own price changes. Option D incorrectly suggests that reduced waste decreases supply.",

      "The supply curve becomes perfectly elastic to accommodate price changes"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "An increase in production costs (such as transportation/fuel costs) reduces profitability at any given price, causing a decrease in supply. This is represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve, meaning producers will supply fewer bananas at each price level than before. Option A represents the common misconception that suppliers increase output to cover higher costs. Option C confuses a cost increase (shift factor) with a price increase (movement factor).",

    "options": [
      "The quantity supplied at $30 will increase to 550kg as farmers try to maintain revenue",
      "The quantity supplied at each price will decrease to the level previously associated with a price $5 lower",

      "Farmers will supply 400kg at $25 instead of $30"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "When production costs increase by $5 per kg, suppliers effectively require an additional $5 to supply any given quantity. Therefore, at a market price of $30, they will now only supply the quantity they previously supplied at $25 (approximately 175kg interpolated, or following the pattern, the quantity associated with $20-25).

      "An immediate shift of the demand curve to the right to absorb the excess supply"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A surplus (excess supply) occurs when quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at the current price, causing suppliers to lower prices to sell unwanted stock. Option A describes the pressure during a shortage. Option C assumes external intervention rather than market price determination.

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Since quantity supplied (8,000) exceeds quantity demanded (5,000), there is a surplus of 3,000 tonnes. This excess supply causes prices to fall to clear the market. Option A incorrectly identifies this as a shortage. Option C erroneously adds the quantities rather than comparing them.

    "explanation": "When |PED| < 1 (inelastic), price and total revenue move in the same direction. A price decrease leads to a proportionally smaller increase in quantity demanded (only 9%: 15% \u00d7 0.6), so total revenue falls.

    "explanation": "When a market is dominated by a few large firms (duopoly in this case) and each firm's pricing or output decisions significantly impact rivals (interdependence), this defines an oligopoly.

    "options": [
      "Barriers to entry are highest in perfect competition and lowest in monopoly",
      "Barriers to entry are lowest in perfect competition (free entry/exit) and highest in monopoly",
      "Barriers to entry are identical across perfect competition, monopolistic competition, and monopoly",
      "Significant barriers to entry exist only in oligopoly markets such as Caribbean banking"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Perfect competition features no barriers (firms freely enter/exit, e.g., street vendors or fish markets). Monopoly has the highest barriers (legal restrictions, control of essential resources, or economies of scale), allowing a single firm to dominate, such as a Caribbean water authority or patent-protected pharmaceutical company.",

    "options": [

      "The fisherman faces a downward-sloping demand curve for his specific fish"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In perfect competition, firms sell homogeneous products and are price takers. The individual fisherman cannot influence the market price and must accept the equilibrium price determined by market forces.

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "GPL represents a natural monopoly where high fixed costs and economies of scale create a barrier to entry. It is more efficient for one firm to supply the entire market than multiple firms.

      "Profits determined solely by government price controls on hair and beauty services"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, free entry and exit ensure that firms earn only normal profit (zero economic profit) in the long run. If firms earn supernormal profits in the short run, new entrants (new salons) will enter, increasing supply and reducing demand for existing firms until only normal profit remains.

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Oligopoly is characterized by mutual interdependence; firms must consider rivals' reactions when setting prices.

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Oligopoly features high barriers to entry such as massive capital requirements (e.g., setting up a telecommunications network or airline), while monopolistic competition has low barriers (e.g., opening a restaurant or small retail shop).

    ],
    "answer": 1,

      "Positive externality in production",
      "Negative externality in production",

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "This is a negative externality in production because the production process imposes external costs (water pollution affecting fish stocks) on third parties (fishing communities) that are not reflected in the market price.

      "Private firms lack the capital to install lighting infrastructure"

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Street lighting is a public good. It is non-excludable (once lit, no one can be prevented from benefiting) and non-rivalrous (one person's use does not diminish another's).

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Vaccinations are merit goods because they are technically private goods (excludable and rivalrous in supply) but are underconsumed because individuals may lack information about the long-term health benefits or underestimate the risks of disease.

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "This represents a positive externality in production. The beekeeper's production activity confers external benefits (pollination) on third parties (fruit farmers) who do not pay for this service. Because the beekeeper does not receive payment for the pollination services, the market underallocates resources to beekeeping compared to the socially optimal level, resulting in market failure.",

However, since the original $10,000 was already part of the money supply, the maximum new deposits created equal $40,000 ($50,000 - $10,000). $2,000 represents required reserves, and $8,000 represents only the first round of lending.",
