It affects all nations regardless of development status. Option A is incorrect because while technology can help us use resources more efficiently, it cannot eliminate scarcity since human wants remain unlimited.

    "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is sacrificed when a choice is made. By allocating his land to sugarcane, the farmer gives up the opportunity to produce rice, making the foregone rice production the opportunity cost. Option A represents the expected benefit of the chosen option, not the cost of the foregone alternative. Option C represents explicit or accounting costs, not opportunity cost.
