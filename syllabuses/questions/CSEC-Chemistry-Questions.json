    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "This describes the properties of a liquid. In the liquid state, particles are close together (giving fixed volume) but have enough kinetic energy to move past one another (allowing the liquid to flow and take the shape of its container).

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Crystallization (or evaporation to crystallization) is the process of forming solid crystals from a solution by removing the solvent. As the water evaporates from the sugarcane juice, the solution becomes saturated and sugar crystals form.

      "The particles combine with particles in the road surface to form a new compound"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "This describes evaporation, a physical change from liquid to gas. As the water absorbs heat from the sun, the particles gain kinetic energy and move faster until they overcome the intermolecular forces holding them together, escaping into the atmosphere as water vapor. The particles themselves remain H\u2082O molecules; no chemical bonds are broken.",

      "Filtration",
      "Evaporation",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Filtration is the separation technique that uses a porous barrier (the cheesecloth) to separate insoluble solid particles (coconut fiber) from a liquid (coconut milk). Decantation would simply involve pouring off the liquid without using a barrier to trap the solids, while evaporation and distillation involve removing the liquid component by heating.",

      "The particles of the seasoning dissolve in the air and chemically react to produce the smell"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "This demonstrates diffusion, where particles move randomly from a region of high concentration (near the jerk pan) to low concentration (throughout the market). The random motion of particles causes them to spread out until evenly distributed. Option A reverses the concentration gradient, Option C ignores the intrinsic motion of particles (they move even in still air), and Option D incorrectly suggests a chemical change occurs rather than physical movement of scent particles.",

      "In ice, particles have no kinetic energy; in liquid, particles have maximum kinetic energy"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "In solids like ice, particles vibrate about fixed positions in a regular lattice. In liquids, particles are still close together but have enough energy to flow over one another. Option B swaps the properties of solids and liquids. Option C describes gases. Option D is incorrect because particles in ice still possess kinetic energy (vibrational), and liquid particles do not have 'maximum' kinetic energy (that would describe a gas at very high temperature).",

    "question": "A chemistry student in Trinidad needs to separate ethanol (boiling point 78\u00b0C) from water (boiling point 100\u00b0C) in a fermented sugar cane solution. Which separation technique is most appropriate for this task?",
    "options": [

      "Decantation using a separating funnel",
      "Paper chromatography using a solvent front"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Simple distillation separates miscible liquids with different boiling points. When heated, ethanol vaporizes first (being more volatile at 78\u00b0C), travels through the condenser, and is collected separately from the water. Filtration (A) separates insoluble solids from liquids. Decantation (C) is used for immiscible liquids or to pour off liquid from settled solids. Chromatography (D) separates small quantities of dissolved substances based on differential adsorption, not for bulk separation of liquids.",

    "explanation": "First, filtration separates the insoluble sand from the salt water (filtrate). Then, simple distillation separates the water from the dissolved salt by evaporation and condensation, leaving the salt crystals behind. Evaporation to dryness first (B) would result in mixed sand and salt solids that cannot be separated by subsequent filtration. Fractional distillation (C) is used for miscible liquids with close boiling points, not for solid-liquid separation.

      "13",
      "14",
      "27",
      "40"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The number of neutrons is calculated by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number (sum of protons and neutrons). For aluminum: 27 - 13 = 14 neutrons. Option A represents the number of protons, C represents the mass number, and D results from incorrectly adding the two values together.",

    "question": "Galvanized zinc roofing sheets are widely used throughout the Caribbean to protect against the corrosive effects of salt-laden sea air. If the zinc coating is scratched, exposing the underlying iron, the iron remains protected because:",

      "Zinc is more reactive than iron and corrodes preferentially",

      "Iron is higher than zinc in the reactivity series",
      "Zinc forms an impermeable oxide layer over the scratch"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Zinc is higher than iron in the reactivity series, making it the sacrificial anode. When scratched, zinc oxidizes (corrodes) in preference to iron, protecting the steel structure. This is called sacrificial protection. If tin (less reactive than iron) were used instead, the iron would corrode faster once the coating is damaged.",

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The position in the reactivity series determines the extraction method. Metals below carbon (like iron, zinc, copper) can be reduced by carbon/carbon monoxide.

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The conversion of SO\u2082 to SO\u2083 is exothermic (releases heat). According to Le Chatelier's principle, higher temperatures would shift equilibrium toward the reactants (SO\u2082), reducing yield. Lower temperatures give better yield but slower rates. 450\u00b0C is a compromise temperature that provides reasonable yield with acceptable reaction rate, facilitated by the catalyst.
