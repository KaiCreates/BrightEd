For CSEC Biology, students are required to complete a School-Based Assessment (SBA) portfolio consisting of at least 18 to 20 practical activities over the two-year period (Form 4 and Form 5).
While the specific experiments can vary slightly by teacher and school, the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) syllabus requires that labs cover specific core topics and assess five specific skills: Observation, Recording & Reporting (ORR), Drawing (Dr), Manipulation & Measurement (MM), Analysis & Interpretation (AI), and Planning & Designing (PD).
Below is the standard list of labs students typically perform, categorized by syllabus section.
Section A: Living Organisms in the Environment
These labs focus on ecology, classification, and soil science.
Classification (Drawing/ORR): Collecting organisms (plants/animals) from a garden and classifying them into groups (e.g., monocot vs. dicot leaves, insects vs. arachnids).
Ecological Study (AI/MM): Using a quadrat to estimate the population density and frequency of plant species in a school field.[1]
Soil Analysis (MM/AI):
Water Holding Capacity: Measuring how much water different soil types (clay, loam, sand) retain.[1]
Soil Sedimentation: Determining the texture/composition of soil by shaking it in water and letting layers settle.
Soil pH: Testing soil samples to see if they are acidic or alkaline.
Section B: Life Processes and Disease
This is the largest section and usually contains the most labs.
Diffusion (ORR): Observing potassium permanganate crystals diffusing in water or ammonia gas diffusing in a tube.
Osmosis (MM/AI):
Potato Strip Experiment: Placing potato strips in salt water vs. distilled water to measure changes in length or mass (turgidity vs. flaccidity).
Visking Tubing: Using dialysis tubing to model cell membrane permeability.
Photosynthesis (AI/ORR):
Testing a Leaf for Starch: Boiling a leaf in alcohol and testing with iodine to show starch presence.
Is Chlorophyll Necessary?: Using a variegated leaf (green and white) to show photosynthesis only occurs in green parts.
Is Light Necessary?: Covering part of a leaf with black paper / foil and testing for starch.
Oxygen Evolution: Counting bubbles produced by a water plant (like Elodea) under different light intensities.
Enzymes (AI/MM):
Effect of Temperature: Testing how different temperatures affect the rate of reaction of catalase (potato/liver) or amylase.
Effect of pH: Testing enzyme activity at different pH levels.
Food Tests (MM/ORR): Chemical tests to identify nutrients in unknown solutions:
Starch: Iodine test (Blue-black color).
Reducing Sugars: Benedict’s solution + heat (Brick red precipitate).
Protein: Biuret test (Purple color).
Fats/Lipids: Emulsion test with ethanol (Cloudy white emulsion).
Respiration (AI/ORR):
Heat Production: Measuring temperature rise in germinating seeds (vacuum flask experiment) to demonstrate heat release during respiration.
Respirometer: Measuring the rate of oxygen uptake by small organisms (like woodlice or maggots).
Transport in Plants (ORR): Placing a celery stalk or white flower in colored water (dye) to visualize xylem vessels.
Germination (ORR/AI): Investigating the conditions necessary for germination (water, oxygen, suitable temperature).
Growth (MM/AI): Measuring the growth of a seedling (height or leaf number) over several weeks and plotting a growth curve (sigmoid curve).
Response/Irritability (ORR):
Phototropism: Demonstrating plants bending toward light using a shoebox maze.
Geotropism: Observing roots growing downward and shoots growing upward using a clinostat.
Section C: Continuity and Variation
These labs cover genetics and reproduction.[2]
Flower Structure (Drawing): Examining a local flower (e.g., Hibiscus or Pride of Barbados) and drawing its reproductive parts (stamen, pistil, ovary).
Fruit & Seed Dispersal (Drawing/ORR): Drawing different fruits and identifying their method of dispersal (wind, water, animal, mechanical).
Storage Organs (Drawing): Drawing cross-sections of storage organs like carrots (root tuber), potatoes (stem tuber), or onions (bulb).
Variation (AI/MM):
Continuous Variation: Measuring height or hand span of classmates and plotting a histogram.
Discontinuous Variation: Surveying tongue rolling or earlobe attachment and plotting a bar chart.
Model of Mitosis/Meiosis (MM): Using clay, yarn, or pipe cleaners to model the stages of cell division.
Mandatory Skills Assessed
Throughout these 18+ labs, your teacher must mark specific ones for CXC moderation. They will look for:
Drawings: Must use clear, solid lines (no sketching), have a title, magnification, and labels with straight lines.
Planning & Design (PD): You will be given a problem statement (e.g., "Do organic fertilizers make plants grow faster?") and you must design an experiment to test it (Hypothesis, Aim, Method, Variables).[2]
Analysis: Ability to explain why the results happened using biological theory.
