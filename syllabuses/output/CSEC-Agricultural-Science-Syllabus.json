E1.1, E1.4 Features of precision agriculture: - Precision agriculture makes use of instruments to detect environmental variations on a farm. - It involves site specific management/It uses environmental information to determine how to vary the level of inputs applied to different sites on the farm. - It reduces the waste of resources/inputs. - It lowers cost of production. Instrument to measure temperature in greenhouse - A temperature data logger. Suitable technology: - Container gardening - Grow boxes. Reasons: - Unavailability of adequate space - Growing media can be specific to crop - Plants can be moved around - Garden can be built anywhere - Compaction is reduced - Pests and weeds are easier to control - A variety of crops is possible - Accessibility - Time and labour savings Management of water supply: - In the rainy season, ensure proper drainage of the soil",
