He himself has a Christian name and doesn\u2019t seem to observe the customs and traditions of India in spite of his repeated references to \u201cMother India\u201d, claiming allegiance to that country c) He is alienated from his family and his hopes for the future. Johnny is largely alienated / separated from his family initially and maintains his own agenda while his wife pursues her own path to marry off their daughter Julia, who herself has plans for herself quite different to her parents. Initially, Johnny does not have a good relationship with either of them, describing his wife as \u2018stupid\u2019 and although he allows his daughter to take commercial lessons, he does not encourage her to get a job or seek her own independence. Yet when she reaches out to him, telling him she has no plans to go to India with him, he accepts her decision and in being reconciled to her, he stops drinking.

They form committees to push the colonial government in Trinidad to organise to send Indians back to India by ship. The government concedes with their demand. b) Economic and educational opportunities transform the values of persons in the community so Johnny who talks endlessly on his inventions, owns his own jewellery shop to make a living, Julia takes commercial classes and gets an opportunity to work and her boyfriend Govind is a minor civil servant while Gopaul, one of the return-to-India committee members is a prosperous businessman who refuses to leave Trinidad to return to India. His values are not aligned to his mission as is seen with many of the other members or followers. c) The community is transformed by divided loyalties and the family community becomes divided since all cannot agree on the way forward eg. While Johnny is keen (at first) to go back to India and his wife is prepared to obediently follow his lead, his daughter is not and she was willing to stay back in Trinidad, even if her parents left to return to India.",

Therefore, both mature during the course of the play and they both eventually step out of their comfort zone to embrace their Afro-Creole neighbours, Rita and Joe. Use of Irony The playwright uses contrasting East Indian characters like Sookdeo and Tiger to highlight a rapidly changing society and the role of education in it. Sookdeo, the old East Indian man is a drunkard but he is literate and he teaches the young Tiger to read. He has lost the respect even of the children in the community who taunt him. Ironically, old Sookdeo reads the newspaper to keep the village abreast of current happenings during the War, while Tiger later reads books and he stores and treasure them. It is ironical that the old drunkard Sookdeo who teaches Tiger to read is suspicious of new devices (the jutebox) and he is equally vicious in the face of new technology like the bulldozer which can uproot an entire balata tree in minutes. When the bulldozer comes to destroy his garden and he stands to lose all his money which he had buried under the mango tree, he rushes madly and fearlessly towards the bulldozer and dies. Use of symbols (symbolic characters and items) Sookdeo represents the old ways while Tiger symbolizes the new. Sookdeo represents the past, while Tiger symbolises present advancements through his books and radio. Tiger talks to Urmilla and explains change to her using the pepper tree as a symbol.

          "objective": "(a) One negative impact of the unequal social status is it complicates the friendship and creates an awkward social distance of which the sensitive Amir (of the upper class) is acutely aware when, confronted by Assef (a member of his own social class) and he cannot justify or explain his friendship with Hassan. Assef confronts him saying, \u201cHow can you call him your friend?\u201d and Amir thinks, But he\u2019s not my friend! I almost blurted. He\u2019s my servant! Had I really thought that? Of course I hadn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t. I treated Hassan well, just like a friend, better even, more like a brother. But if so, then why, when Baba\u2019s friends came to visit with their kids, didn\u2019t I ever include Hassan in our games? Why did I play with Hassan only when no one else was around? (pg. 41) (b) The negative impact is this friendship is tainted by jealousy triggered by their differing social status between Amir and Hassan. Ironically, it aroused the rich boy\u2019s jealousy not the poor boy\u2019s envy.
